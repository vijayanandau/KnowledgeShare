Install Makahiki
================

Makahiki supports two forms of installation: local (on your own machine)
and cloud-based (to the Heroku application hosting service).

Developers of Makahiki will want to install the system locally.

Organizations will want to install Makahiki locally if they wish to host
the system themselves.  This requires sufficient hardware resources
and IT support to do the installation, perform backups, and monitor the
system during the challenge and deal with any outages that occur. 

Organizations can instead choose to host Makahiki with Heroku.  This incurs
a cost (we estimate from $50-$100 per month of the challenge), but has the benefit
that no hardware or IT resources are required.
