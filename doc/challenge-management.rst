Challenge Management
====================

About challenge management
--------------------------

Challenge management refers to administrative activities that take place while a challenge
is underway.  For example, when players submit answers to actions in the Smart Grid Game,
an administrator must review the answer and decide whether to award points.  Another
challenge management activity is the generation and printing of attendance codes to give
out to players who have attended an event.  There are many such management activities, all
of which are (hopefully) documented in this section.
