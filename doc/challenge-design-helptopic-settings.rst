About the help topics

Makahiki includes a set of help contents about the game website, they are presented to players in:

  * A help page that displays the rules of the challenges and frequently asked questions
  * the contextualized help text for each widget when you click on the question mark icon on the top-right corner of each widget.

These help contents are stored in the Makahiki database which could be modified by the challenge desiger.

.. note:: Configuration of the help topic is **optional**, as long as you are satisfied with the default values.
