By default, you will see all submitted actions with the "Pending approval" status. You can click on the link to see the submission details and do the approval there. Or, if the question and answer of the action is simple enough, you can select the action or several actions and use the "Action" dropdown "Approve the selected actions (USE CAUTION)" to approve the selected actions.

You can also go in to the "Change action member" page to look at the full question and answer of the submission, change the "Approval status" and provide the "Admin comment" back to the player.

You will only need to approve the "Activity" type actions, which requires players submitting their answers or responses. For "Commitment" type actions, the system will automatically approve the submission when the player submits after the commitment period ends. For "Event" and "Excursion" type actions, the system will also automatically approve them when the player submits the correct confirmation code.
