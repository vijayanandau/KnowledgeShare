Site Configuration
==================

About site configuration
------------------------

This section explains how to configure a freshly initialized instance of Makahiki to suit
the characteristics of your IT infrastructure.  It assumes you have completed the steps to
install Makahiki either locally or globally following the instructions in
:ref:`section-installing-makahiki`, that you initialized the instance using the "default"
fixture, and that the server is now running.

In this section, all URLs will refer to a locally running instance of Makahiki
(i.e. http://127.0.0.1:8000).  Please substitute the host and port number of
your instance when following the instructions below.

Site configuration differs from challenge design in that it requires "system
administration" skills:  you must understand IT infrastructure issues such as email
transport, authentication, and so forth.
