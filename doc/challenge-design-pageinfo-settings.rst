Makahiki defines a default set of pages for the game website. A page is associated with a nagivation icon and label on the top of the website interface, the icon and introduction text on the website home page, a condition for displaying and hiding the page, as well as the game widgets on the page.

.. note:: Configuration of the page is **optional**, as long as you are satisfied with the default values.
