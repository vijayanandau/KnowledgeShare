Design the Top Score Game
=========================

About the Top Score Game
------------------------

The Top Score Game enables you to design a challenge in which prizes are awarded to
individuals and teams who earn the most points during the challenge (and/or each round in
a challenge).   It also enables you to award prizes to the teams that conserved the most
energy (or some other resource such as water) during the challenge (and/or each round in
the challenge). 

If the Top Score Game is enabled, then you can enable both a Leaderboard widget that shows the top
players/team in contention for each round, and a Prizes widget that shows the prizes for
for each round and the current team/individual in line to win them.
